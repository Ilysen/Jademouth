			<text>Excellent! Thank you so much. I'm afraid I'm not actually wholly sure where to start, but I have a few ideas.
			
			Warm static originates from the Moon Stair, but that's likely not a place you want to visit. The alchemist in Bethesda Susa is an expert in this sort of thing as well, but finding them is a journey in its own right. If you cannot find them, only then would I risk the Stair.
			
			Should you be inclined to search at the source, you will be hunting a certain type of jell. Warm static of the purity I seek is supposedly harvested from its corpse, but you may need to dispatch several of them to find an appropriate sample - and if you use heat-based weapons, it would likely be destroyed outright.
		
			Be cautious. I have heard stories. And when you do find the static, DO NOT do anything else with it. Bring it directly here.</text>

		<node ID="Reminder">
			<text>A highly entropic liquid, called warm static. I believe it may be able to help me tolerate the light again. It originates from the Moon Stair, and if you have no other options, I believe you could source it from a certain type of ooze there. A much safer idea would be to find the alchemist, in Bethesda Susa. I only need a dram, but it needs to be pure - if it's dilute or otherwise contaminated, it won't work for my purposes.</text>

			<text>Much better, thanks to you! I seem to have mostly lost my sense of pain, which is both a good and bad thing given my occupation. I also miss my arms, but I'm acclimating.

			<text>Cat and I used to... well. We were very close. She became much harder to talk to when she took on the mantle of warden. Eventually we fell out of touch. With how miserable I was in the light, I rarely ever interacted with her. I guess there was some resentment.
			
			Now that I can go outside again, I see her a lot more. I like to believe that she's starting to warm up again; the other day she even laughed with me. It isn't much, but I'm thankful to be on talking terms with her again.</text>
